At Montessori Way Preschool, children are exposed to a well-prepared environment that consists of academics (mathematics, language, science), arts and music and movement. Children learn by using the many hands-on Montessori materials and by being in an environment that allows them to work at their own level in a mixed-age group without feeling peer pressure.",

Our core concept is to stimulate the growth of the child as a whole; they will not only achieve academically but will also learn to be self-directed, independent, and discover themselves and the world around them.",
